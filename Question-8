1) Yes, the University of Helsinki did the Glanville fritillary butterfly genome project

2) LiSs (Linkage Map Superscaffolder) for super scaffolding. 
3) Lep-MAP software was used for constructing accurate linkage maps using high-density SNP data. MIP Scaffolder for genome scaffolding, LiSs (Linkage map Superscaffolder) for superscaffolding, and Coral and HybridSHREC for read error correction. 
4) Yes,

5) RAD Seq, which is restriction site associated DNA marker sequencing. It uses RAD markers that flank a particular restriction enzyme site in the genome.  Once these areas have been isolated, they can be used to identify and genotype DNA sequence polymorphisms in the form of SNPs.
