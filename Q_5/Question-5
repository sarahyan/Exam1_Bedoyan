Eukaryotic genomes are usually divided into two or more linear DNA molecules, each contained in a different chromosome; all eukaryotes also possess smaller, usually circular, mitochondrial genomes.  Prokaryotes have a lot smaller genomes, and an entire prokaryotic genome is contained in a single circular DNA molecule.
